# The div tag

## What is it?

The div tag is used as a generic container which groups content, and makes styling the content inside it easier.

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="head-title">
            <h1>Website</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="main-content">
            <h3>Hello World</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        </div>
     </body>
</html>
```

Instead of having to style each tag one by one, you can wrap all of it inside divs and set a class on it, then style the div itself
